This E-commerce Product Page project is a front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a catalog of products with search, category, and price filters, allowing users to browse and add items to a shopping cart. The cart dynamically updates totals and supports item removal. Users can purchase items by entering their email, and the purchase summary—including item details and total cost—is sent via email using Formspree integration. If no products match the filters, a message is shown. The project also uses localStorage to retain cart contents across sessions, creating a complete yet lightweight shopping experience
